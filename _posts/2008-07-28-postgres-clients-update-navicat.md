Navicat already produced some lite (free) versions for Postgres both for Windows and Mac. Browse over the [feature matrix][1] to find out which [version][2] works for you. Note that all versions allow you to edit the record which I can&#8217;t do in pgadmin3.

A quick look at EMS on Windows (VMWare) is also a note worthy client. Though the MDI interface is a bit complex, one good feature is to able to see your spatial geometry as *text* and the corresponding SRID immediately&#8230;
