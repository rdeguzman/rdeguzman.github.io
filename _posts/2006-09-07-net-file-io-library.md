FileHelpers library from  [www.filehelpers.com][1] could help in reading and writing to files, streams or even as a DataTable for your .NET Applications. I am currently using this library for a Simple Pocket PC Data Viewer which I called iVIEWPPCViewer. The iVIEWPPCViewer contains  DataGrid which could be populated from the FileHelpersEngine.
