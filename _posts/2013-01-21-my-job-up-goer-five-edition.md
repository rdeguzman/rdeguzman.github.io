My son just know that I work with phones and computers. But sometimes he ask a lot and it&#8217;s so hard to explain. Inspired by [US Space Team&#8217;s UP Goer Five][1] and [some job descriptions over the net][2], I decided to roll out my ownâ€¦ see permalink [here][3]

My job as a software developer (UP-Goer Fiver Edition):

> I work with phones and computers to show where a car is on the road. We fit a very small phone and computer inside the car which talks to a bigger computer in our building. Most of the time, I work on the bigger computers in our office to store the car tracks.
> 
> Once I know the position of the car, I work on some amazing stuff like drawing the trail of the car, suggesting interesting places near the car and suggesting the best direction from one place to another. This helps the car to reach the place faster and avoid other cars on the street. 
> 
> Sometimes the car is stuck or it rolls over, so it asks the bigger computer for help by telling business people with their phones. Those business people with big cars have goods and stuff and I need to find their car any where in the world! So I have to use a different computer which flies over the world and it talks in between the car and the big computer in our office. It&#8217;s a lot of work sometimes but I enjoy it.
