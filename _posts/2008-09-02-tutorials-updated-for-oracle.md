It was a gruesome day.. I have an oracle10g on my MacBookPro running on VMWare (WindowsXPSP3, let&#8217;s call this orawin). I have another setup box (CentOS5 + oracle11g = oralin) just this morning. I imported the tables from my orawin10g to my oralin11g, created the indexes for the tables in oralin11g. I ran my spatial test query on orawin10(0.692192571 secs); I ran the same query on oralin11g (14.89 secs). I viewed the execution plans and both are the same!

Eventually, whatever works.. I have to drop the oracle11g and install Oracle10g instead. I have updated the [Tutorials Page][1] to include this, as well as the [Oracle CheatSheet][2].
