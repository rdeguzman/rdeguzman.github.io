I was the youngest of four siblings and was born in Manila, after my family migrated from Vietnam just after the war.  Though poor, my father (Filipino) and mother (Vietnamese) provided us with as much as they can.  My mother was very thrifty and I use to remember having veggies planted on our backyard for food, ampalaya (bitter-melon), chilis, camote tops and mostly corn.  

During primary school, my father just landed a surveying job in Saudi Arabia, this was good as we now have some money.  My eldest brother was taken as a scholar in the University of the Philippines (UP) and influenced my mother to get us a better education. I went into a private catholic high school (Marist) for boys.  I love math subjects during high school, particularly algebra, geometry, trigonometry, etc.  

By college, I was accepted in UP but it was regional (Laguna) for a degree in Applied Mathematics.  Since it was regional, I decided to transfer to its main campus as it was closer to home, travel and food expenses will be cheaper.  My father being a surveyor, persuaded me to take up a Bechelors in Geodetic Engineering (a.k.a Geomatics in some unis).  I loved UP, it was there I learned how to study and work hard at the same time.

I tried to get an engineering surveying job (FF Cruz) during my last semester in college.  However, the pay was small, P6,000/month, roughly $150 dollars at that time.  I bounced upon an engineering firm (Cybersoft) near school and they were doing GIS at that time.  I walked in there ofc and handed my paper resume.  I got a call from them and asked me if I was interested in a programming role but for a sister company, KSDI.  I said I dont know anything about programming but I will give it a shot. This was the start of my career as a software developer, and looking back, if I didn't walked in that building I would not be where I am now.

In 2001, my first job in KSDI was to do a travel website. I learned mysql and coldfusion (CF) and my first glimpse on linux--redhat6.2.  I coded on windows and scp the lot to the linux machine.  I got sick of doing it, learned VI and edited on the machine itself.  I met life long friends on my first job and didn't know that I will venture into a travel hobby project with one of them in the future.

By the end of 2001, BPO was booming, Adobe both Macromedia, and outsourced technical support for ColdFusion and Jrun to Manila thru Sykes Asia (a big call center operations). I got in and my salary was tripled, but I wasn't happy. I was not coding.  I left them after a few months and went back to my first job.  I also got married to my neighbor at this time.

The KSDI owners owned a BPO company for medical transcription (TTSI).  They asked me if I wanted another side job after my day job.  I took it as my wife was pregnant. In programming, it was hello Java. But oh no, it was Java Swing!  Anyway, traffic was getting bad and I asked my wife if we move closer to the office so I could just walk from home to ofc and it was cheaper.

On 2003, I decided to study in Australia and pursue a formal software degree, but my money didnt get that far and my wife was giving birth to our first son, so I exited with a diploma instead and went back to Manila on 2004.

The KSDI and TTSI owner asked me if I could join them in their other company Cybersoft (the engineering firm I first applied during college) as their lead systems administrator is migrating to Canada.  From 2004-2006, I lead a development team and reported directly to mgmt.  I was rapidly building CF applications for location mobile value added services for big Telcos.  Work was intense and sometimes I get to home in the morning but I enjoyed it.  I was also doing mapping on the Web and got exposed to opensource MapServer and OpenLayers.

On 2006, my boss landed an opportunity to setup a company in Beijing, China.  So I took my family with me and stayed in China for 2-3 years.  I started using Ruby On Rails and switched from mysql to postgres. I started blogging during this time and wrote as I learned on the job.  I added postgis into my opensource GIS mix as well.

Though I loved my career and relationship with my Cybersoft boss, on 2009, my wife and I decided to migrate to Australia. My sister and mother was in Australia and my wife's brother was in Sydney.  I moved to Melbourne as there were more GIS/programming jobs there. I worked as a .NET software developer for PelicanCorp and started exploring mobile development as Apple just released the iphones. I developed a dial before you dig mobile application in iOS for PelicanCorp and it won a few awards like the Navteq Challenge.  

While in AU, I missed the Philippines.  I started a hobby mobile travel project with one of my colleagues from my very first job!  MyTravelPhilippines was born.
