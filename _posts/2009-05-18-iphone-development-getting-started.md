After moving from Beijing to Manila to Perth to Melbourne, now Im making most of my time in iPhone Development. Last week, I just applied for the iPhone Standard Developer Program and was able to test on an actual iPhone 3G device running on iPhone 2.2.1. Note that I haven&#8217;t downloaded the iPhone 3.0 OS Beta yet as I am still figuring things out but will do so in the next two weeks. My carrier sucks and I&#8217;ve used 14GB out of my 20GB allowance so Im delaying the download of the iPhone 3.0 SDK. Crap.

**Learning curve..**

1. First and foremost, you need a Mac and an iPhone.

2. Familiarize yourself with [iPhone Developer Central][1]

3. Meet Objective-C.

4. [Introduction to Objective-C 2.0 Programming Language][2]

5. [Learn Objective C from cocoadevcentral][3]

6. [Leopard Guides: Cocoa Objective-C Language][4]

7. Haven&#8217;t tried XCode before? Get a brief introduction from [BecomeAnXcoder][5]

8. [CS193 from Stanford University.][6] I believe it is essential to go through a few documents and tutorials listed above before being lazy and watching the videos.

I strongly recommend going through the Assignments as well.

9. [iPhone Application Programming Guide][7]

10. Read [Quartz 2D Programming Guide][8] if you are into graphics.

It&#8217;s my practice to learn a language from the Documentation itself before reading through books. But [Programming in Objective-C from Stephen Kochan][9] is worth a look. I haven&#8217;t read [iPhone SDK Development from the Pragmatic Bookshelf][10] but since Bill Dudney is one of the core developers for ObjC, my *guess* it would be good.
