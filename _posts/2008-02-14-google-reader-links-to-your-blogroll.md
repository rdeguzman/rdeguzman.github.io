It is so eeeassy to publish blog links in your WordPress Blog from Google Reader using an OPML file. OPML is a file type that is widely used to distribute lists of RSS/newsfeeds. [You could also grab other feeds and see it in Google Reader.][1]

1. Login to your Google Reader with your Google Account.  
2. Click on Settings.  
3. Then Import/Export.  
4. You will see &#8220;Export your subscriptions as an OPML file.&#8221;  
5. Import to WordPress.
