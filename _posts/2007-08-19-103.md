<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
One of the upcoming power features of Mapserver 5.0 is its AGG Rendering engine. Above is an example image of the AGG rendering capabilities of Mapserver. Below is a list of my experiences with Mapserer 5.0 AGG</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower than GD ofcourse, but cartographic quality is really impressive&#8230;</li>
<li>You need to have SUPPORT=AGG to be able to use AGG. So far, I was not able to compile mapserver source with AGG, however using <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/download/beta/">mapserver-beta-3 for linux</a> and <a href="http://www.maptools.org/ms4w/index.phtml?page=downloads.html">ms4w betas</a> worked fine.</li>
<li>Layer Transparency. I was not able to get transparency for my roads overlaying on top of my basemap. Tbonfort from IRC suggested I use RGBA for the outputformat, but it still breaks. Hope Im not missing anything important here&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Mapfile</strong><br />
Currently, the mapfile ( <em>map_all_agg.map</em> ) contains 2,587 lines! The lengthy mapfile consists of the ff: <em>districts or political boundaries, water bodies, greens or open spaces, roads, subway lines, subway stops</em>. The roads is classified into 12 categories ( <em>Expressway, Class-1, Class-2, Class-3, Class-4, Major Road, Main, Secondary, Minor, CommunityRoad(w/name), CommunityRoad, ParkRoads</em>). <em>Class1-4</em> is a classification for Roads outside the 5th Ring Road of Beijing. While <em>Major Roads &#8211; Minor Roads</em> is a classification inside the 5th Ring.  The roads were drawn as a line layer and not as a polygon.</p>
<p>How to achieve the overlapping of road intersections?<br />
The technique is to seperate the road boundary layer from the actual road line. A mixture of <em>widths</em> and <em>color management</em> was employed to achieve the effect. Essentially, we started with the ff:</p>
<p>1.  road boundary layer<br />
2.  road layer</p>
<p>Further , trial and error resulted in refining the road boundary layer with different minscales and maxscales. The same was adapted with the road layer. Download <a href="http://www.gisnotes.com/images/2007/08/map_all_agg.txt" title="map_all_agg.txt">map_all_agg.txt</a>.  My next iteration, would be to refactor some of the road layers if possible.</p>
<p>A couple of notes to myself, we could speed things up by trying out the ff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using SHPTREE</li>
<li>Simplifying the geometry as you change scales</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Testing Methodology</strong><br />
1. Use Firefox and install firebug.<br />
2. Download YSlow from Yahoo.<br />
3. View load times using <em><strong>&#8220;net&#8221;</strong></em> tab<br />

<p><strong><a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ShpTree">Using SHPTREE</a></strong><br />
1. The utility specifies indexes as it slices the shapefile into quadrants as specified from its definition. To run shptree, do the ff:<br />
<code><br />
$ shptree roads.shp<br />
creating index of new  LSB format<br />
</code></p>
<p>2. It would generate a <em>roads.qix</em>. No changes need to be made with the mapfile. Mapserver loads the shapefile without the extension.</p>
<p>3. Testing&#8230; Significant speed improvements were made as shown below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Before: 29.44 secs</li>
<li>After:    5.91 secs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
