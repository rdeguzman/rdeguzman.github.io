***I can not argue enough how valuable an iphone stencil will be in seeing the overall design/flow of an application. I should have done this a long time ago.*** 

Well, I am also one of those eager developers who dives right into coding and see how it goes. But after having the fundamentals of iphone development, objective-c, and app-store submission, I&#8217;m taking on a different approach by creating screen mockups mainly for the following reasons:

1. Reach out quickly to the client. 

2. Provides a bird&#8217;s eye view of the whole application. Provides alternative screens for a better user experience..

3. A follow up on the screen mockups is a powerpoint with actual links to other slides thus mimicing an iphone interface. Note, it is not a complete replica of the simulator but just enough for decision makers to understand what&#8217;s in there.

*In powerpoint, you can just quickly overlay a transparent polygon on top of the UIButton then attach a hyperlink to another slide.*

Hope this post helps you even if it&#8217;s not related to coding. On my next post, which is currently buried in my drafts&#8211;hopefully it will not be that long, I learned about integrating with Mobile Advertising Networks.
