I have a geo degree background, formally Geomatics, but I am a self taught programmer, been a sysad for a few years, been a lead from small to med size team.  This blog was created on 2006 when I decided to make notes on things and experiences I am sure to forget in the future.  Through the years, it became more "geo" tech focused, so I decided to buy the domain name geonotes.com which now became geocoding.io.
