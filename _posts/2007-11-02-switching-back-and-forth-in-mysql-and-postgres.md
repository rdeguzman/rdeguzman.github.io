<p>There is no way I could accomplish better data manipulation between MySQL and PostGres without Navicat. Just to be clear, I do not work for Navicat.  These tools were able to help me export data out of MySQL and import it to PostGres. It is just one of those products that really deserve credit.</p>

<p>Take note though that you can not see the <em>&#8220;messages&#8221;</em> displayed by the <em>&#8220;raise command&#8221;</em> in PL/PGSQL when using Navicat 8 for PostGres. I have to switch back to using pgAdmin III or my standard command line.</p>
