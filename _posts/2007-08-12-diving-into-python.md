Yup, Im now diving into Python. So far, Im loving it. Not as hard as java, very pragmatic programming. I got converted when I saw [Awaretek&#8217;s &#8220;Python Learning Foundation&#8221;][1] which I believe deserves a lot of merit for promoting Python. One of the podcasts from [www.directionmag.com][2] states that Python is #4 among GIS professional as a *must-have* progamming language experience.

Moving forward, I kickstarted with a few tutorials. Fast-reading most of the tutorials from <http://www.upriss.org.uk/python/PythonCourse.html> and trying out the exercises. It was fabolous. Simple yet powerful. Then I saw Alex Martelli&#8217;s tutorial from <http://www.aleax.it/Python/py25.pdf>. Those who have programming experience like Java/C, would benefit much from Martell&#8217;s PDF tutorial.

Next stop.. using databases with python.. Head on to the database section of [AwareTek][1].

1. I&#8217;ve dowloaded Python&#8217;s DB Interface for Postgres &#8216;*psycopg2*&#8216;. <http://www.initd.org/tracker/psycopg/wiki/PsycopgTwo>

2. [Steve Holden&#8217;s dbPythonIntro.pdf][3]. Presents a quick overview of the DB API. Important pages would be:

*   26/65 Connection Example (includes Postgres)
*   29/65 Connection Methods
*   30/65 Executing Queries
*   31/65 Retrieving Results

3. [Accessing PostgreSQL with Python and Psycopg2][4]. This three page tutorial will quickly give you a background of how to execute queries, fetch queries using *column index* or by *names*.
