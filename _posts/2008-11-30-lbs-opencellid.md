Interesting to see there was an opensource initiative to map cellIDs. Don&#8217;t know if Google made the same process for Google Maps MyLocation but I guess its very similar. Would it be possible to integrate such technology for SMS/USSD Development? Meaning when a mobile request to a back end system, the cellID would be included in the header before being passed to the application. I am fully aware this process is possible, however, I&#8217;m wondering if it is possible without installing any application (most likely j2me) on the mobile?
