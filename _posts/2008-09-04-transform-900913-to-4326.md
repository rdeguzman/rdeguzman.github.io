Stumbled upon an error in reprojecting data from 900913 (Google Speherical Mercator) to 4326 (WGS84). I&#8217;m recalling this from my head now, the error was something related to &#8220;NAD sth&#8221;. Workaround was to convert it as follows:

1. 900913  
2. 32650 (UTM for your area)  
3. 4326

I&#8217;ll get the SQL from my ofcmate and paste it here&#8230;
