My main editor of choice is mostly **vi/vim**. As I was having problems with the &#8216;readonly&#8217; capability of vi on my winxp, I got curious on the state of editors out there. Contenders would be TextPad, Notepad2, Notepad++, and UltraEdit. Here&#8217;s a summary:

[TextPad][1]

*   Free
*   Lightweight
*   Opened up a js file with some Chinese on it. Boom, it converts it to dos.
*   Overall: I uninstalled it

[Notepad2][2]

*   Free
*   Lightweight
*   Python syntax highlighting is built-in. Cool. Need to check other languages though.
*   Chinese is fine.
*   Overall: Good Notepad replacement for small editing.

[UltraEdit13.10a][3]

*   Commercial
*   Heavyweight yet powerful
*   Lots of syntax highlighting for PLs. I added Python and ColdFusion already! [UltraEdit WordList][4]
*   Chinese is fine.
*   Overall: Useful for serious editing&#8230;

Note:  
You need to append the *downloaded wordlist.txt *to your *current wordlist* and change &#8216;L10&#8242; to a free number, say &#8216;L19&#8242;. By default, UltraEdit have L01-L13.

Happy Editing!
