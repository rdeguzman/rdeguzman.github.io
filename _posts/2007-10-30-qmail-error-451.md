Finally, I was able to nail down the PBL problems I had with my qmail server. I was able to use Outlook 2007/2003 to use my pop/smtp. To use Outlook 2007, you should have the ff settings:

1. Tools -> Account Settings.  
2. Click on the desired account  
3. Click on &#8220;More Settings&#8221; button  
4. In the outgoing server tab, ensure that you have &#8220;My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication&#8221; checked.  
5. In the outgoing server tab, ensure that you have &#8220;Use same settings as my incoming mail server&#8221; checked.  
6. In the Advanced Tab, you can set it to &#8220;Auto&#8221;

**Spamhaus problem. 451 http://www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=219.142.133.68. **  
You can remove spamhaus when you send email, but that&#8217;s quite dangerous. If you want to completely remove the PBL checking,

1. Check your blacklist settings. You can remove the line below, or change it to an PBL listings like <http://forum.qmailrocks.org/archive/index.php/t-3103.html>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">more</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>var<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>qmail<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>control<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>blacklist
<span style="color: #660033;">-r</span> sbl.spamhaus.org</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

2. Restart qmail

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>etc<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>init.d<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>qmailctl stop
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>etc<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>init.d<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>qmailctl start</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

**553 sorry, that domain isn&#8217;t in my list of allowed rcpthosts (#5.5.3 &#8211; chkuser)**  
Here&#8217;s a good description of the problem on relaying. <a herf="http://www.palomine.net/qmail/relaying.html">http://www.palomine.net/qmail/relaying.html<br /> </a>. If you &#8220;enabled smtp authentication&#8221; and used your settings for loggin-in, then this would not happen. I experienced this when I changed my Outlook 2007 settings to &#8220;Log on to incoming mail server before sending mail&#8221;.
