I&#8217;ve found this tool which could display my Symbian phone in my Mac using WLAN. It supports BT, WLAN, and USB. So far, WLAN works for me so I sticked with it.

1. Download the software from [http://www.digia.com/][1]

2. Install the sis to your Nokia phone. Mine is an E61 so I paired it using BT on my mac.

3. Once installed, fill up the options on your phone&#8230; then try to &#8216;CONNECT&#8217;

Connection: TCP/IP  
Access Point: Ofc (or Define an access point)  
TCP/IP Host: 192.168.1.150 (IP address of my mac)

Fig 1 Trial mode lets you use it for the next **two** minutes with a big &#8216;TRIAL&#8217; display on screen.
