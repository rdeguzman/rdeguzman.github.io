<p>I&#8217;ve been searching this from big-o-Goog from a long time now (two months?).  During development, instead of searching the keyword from Eclipse, I still feel very much in control when I am using the commandline&#8211;using <em>grep</em>.  Courtesy of this <a href="http://justinsomnia.org/2006/09/how-to-grep-without-hitting-subversions-text-base-files/">blog post, </a>a big time and eye strain saver when doing a grep in a directory full with svn base files and directories is using <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/contrib/client-side/wcgrep">WCGREP</a>.</p>
